## Why is Bruno Mars my top artist?
Although this may seem like an odd choice since he has not released new music in a while, Bruno Mars is my favorite artist. He has such a diverse portfolio, with music ranging from funk to EDM. My personal favorite album is Doo-Wops and Hooligans, which includes songs such as "Runaway Baby," "Talking to the Moon," "The Other Side," and "Liqour Store Blues." In addition to being a very versatile artist, he is also an amazing live performer. His voice is just as impressive in live performances, which is accompanied by his charisma and dancing abilities.
